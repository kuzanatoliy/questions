  <summary>What is Certificate Transparency?</summary>

Certificate Transparency is an open framework designed to protect against and monitor for certificate mis-issuances. It's defined in [RFC 9162](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9162). With certificate transparency, newly-issued certificates are 'logged' to publicly-run, often independent CT logs â€” which maintain an append-only, cryptographically-assured record of issued TLS certificates.
