  <summary>What is Certificate Transparency?</summary>

Certificate Transparency is an open framework designed to protect against and monitor for certificate mis-issuances. It's defined in [RFC 9162](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9162). With certificate transparency, newly-issued certificates are 'logged' to publicly-run, often independent CT logs â€” which maintain an append-only, cryptographically-assured record of issued TLS certificates.

Example:

    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload

  <summary>What is X-Frame-Options?</summary>

The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a frame, iframe, embed or object. Sites can use this to avoid click-jacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.
