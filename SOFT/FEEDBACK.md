  <summary>When feedback is GIFT?</summary>

**G**ive with permission - If someoune does not come to you specifically asking for feedback, consider asking someone if you can provide feedback, before you just give it;

**I**ntent is for Growth - Feedback needs to be articulated in a way that moveas us forward;

**F**or the Person, not about the person - It's usually easy to change one's own behavior and situational factors, but almost impossible to change core personality attributes;

**T**argeted for Success - Feedback needs to be on-going and followed up on. Success is a journey.
