# Tactics

  <summary>What are tactics principles?</summary>

1. Hurry slowly. Any benefit or concession must accrue to the other party as a result of some conscious effort. What comes easily is usually not appreciated.
2. Get close. Yielding in something to the other side, keep track of what is more effective instead. Be sure to evaluate that the other side also made commensurate steps in the meeting.
3. Fact for fact. If you provide a partner with material benefits, then in return, also demand some kind of "monetized", in fact, progress of the other side.
4. Do not bribe the respondent partner. An undeserved concession at the start may not only fail to “buy the favor” of the other side, but whet the appetite even more and seem like a more aggressive, manipulative action.
