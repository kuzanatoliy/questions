# Tactic

  <summary>What are tactic principles?</summary>

1. Hurry slowly. Any benefit or concession must accrue to the other party as a result of some conscious effort. What comes easily is usually not appreciated.
2. Get close. Yielding in something to the other side, keep track of what is more effective instead. Be sure to evaluate that the other side also made commensurate steps in the meeting.
3. Fact for fact. If you provide a partner with material benefits, then in return, also demand some kind of "monetized", in fact, progress of the other side.
4. Do not bribe the respondent partner. An undeserved concession at the start may not only fail to “buy the favor” of the other side, but whet the appetite even more and seem like a more aggressive, manipulative action.

### Constructive tactics

  <summary>What is 'one cuts, the other chooses' tactic?</summary>

If it is needed to share powers or functions, offer your partner this way out: he must share, and you will choose one of the two parts. Fearing to receive a smaller share, he will do everything so that the parts are equal, and will also imbue you with respect for the trust placed in him.

If it is not possible to reach agreement on all points of the agreement, the disputed issues are not considered.

By agreeing on individual aspects, you will quickly come to a compromise solution to the problem.
