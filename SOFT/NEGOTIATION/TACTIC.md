# Tactic

<details>
  <summary>What are tactic principles?</summary>

1. Hurry slowly. Any benefit or concession must accrue to the other party as a result of some conscious effort. What comes easily is usually not appreciated.
2. Get close. Yielding in something to the other side, keep track of what is more effective instead. Be sure to evaluate that the other side also made commensurate steps in the meeting.
3. Fact for fact. If you provide a partner with material benefits, then in return, also demand some kind of "monetized", in fact, progress of the other side.
4. Do not bribe the respondent partner. An undeserved concession at the start may not only fail to “buy the favor” of the other side, but whet the appetite even more and seem like a more aggressive, manipulative action.

### Constructive tactics

<details>
  <summary>What is 'one cuts, the other chooses' tactic?</summary>

If it is needed to share powers or functions, offer your partner this way out: he must share, and you will choose one of the two parts. Fearing to receive a smaller share, he will do everything so that the parts are equal, and will also imbue you with respect for the trust placed in him.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is 'put controversial questions out of brackets' tactic?</summary>

If it is not possible to reach agreement on all points of the agreement, the disputed issues are not considered.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is 'divide the problem into parts' tactic?</summary>

By agreeing on individual aspects, you will quickly come to a compromise solution to the problem.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is 'gradually increase the difficulty' tactic?</summary>

To create a friendly environment, start with the issues that cause the least controversy. If you manage to avoid active confrontation at the very beginning, it will be easier for you to find a common language with your partner throughout the meeting.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is 'emphasize commonality' tactic?</summary>

Remind your partner that you have a lot in common: an interest in a positive outcome of the negotiations, the desire to avoid losses, long-term relationships. This way you will show that the overall benefit of the joint event is important to you, and not just your own benefit.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is 'get ahead of the objections' tactic?</summary>

Point out the weaknesses of your firm and your offerings before your partner does. By this you seem to show: "I want to avoid disputes! I admit my mistakes!" With this technique, you will demonstrate your objectivity.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is 'return to discussion' tactic?</summary>

Return to the discussion of the problem if you notice that the partner was not satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations or that he did not understand any part of the contract. Your partner will be grateful for your participation and attention.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is 'postpone negotiations' tactic?</summary>

If it is needed to think about a proposal or agree on an issue with others, offer to defer consideration of this negotiation item. To prevent your partner from thinking that you are dragging out the negotiations, agree in advance the time when you will return to the discussion of the issue, and the reason why you cannot resolve all the contradictions at the moment.

</details>

### Destructive tactics

<details>
  <summary>What is 'increasing requirements' tactic?</summary>

As the negotiations progress, one of the participants starts with small requests, gradually moving to more significant ones. This technique is sometimes referred to as "foot in the door". This tactic may arise as a misuse of the tactic of tackling "first the easy questions, then the harder ones."

**What to do:** ask your partner what question is the most important for him.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is 'refusal of own offers' tactic?</summary>

One of the parties puts forward a proposal, which is then withdrawn under various pretexts. The goals of such tactics can be different: delaying negotiations; an attempt to bargain more, unwillingness to solve anything at all through negotiations, etc.

**What to do:** ask about past agreements and why they no longer work.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is 'false accents' tactic?</summary>

The second party makes obviously inadequate or unacceptable proposals for you. In the future, they are removed, and the negotiator receives the necessary decision on another, more important issue for him.

**What to do:** specify what is actually a priority for the second party; "bracket out" additional or minor details.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is 'bluff' tactic?</summary>

The second party provides deliberately false information. For example, a negotiator may describe their business as the best, with a great reputation, but is in fact bankrupt and struggling to get orders.

**What to do:** request a "hard", i.e. facts and examples confirming the position of the other side.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is 'salami' tactic?</summary>

The second side gives information about their own interests, grades, etc. in very small portions - according to the principle of cutting salami sausage. The meaning of the reception is to force the partner to be the first to "reveal their cards" and choose a strategy of behavior depending on what they hear. The use of this technique turns into an artificial dragging out of negotiations to the detriment of the cause.

**What to do:** emphasize common interests, identify joint risks if an agreement is not reached.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is 'extortion' tactic?</summary>

One of the parties unexpectedly puts forward new demands at the end of the negotiations. The side proceeds from the fact that its partner, being extremely interested in signing the reached agreements, will make concessions.

**What to do:** use the tactics of partial agreement; say that the proposed options are feasible, but this is a topic for a separate conversation, so during the current meeting you will focus on existing agreements; be willing to withdraw from the agreement if your demands are not met.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is 'ultimatum' tactic?</summary>

The negotiator, who usually has a strong position, immediately voices his demands in an ultimatum tone. All attempts to reach a compromise or mitigate the situation are not accepted.

**What to do:** accept the ultimatum as two possible solutions; look for alternative solutions.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is 'double interpretation' tactic?</summary>

One of the parties lays a double meaning in the wording of the documents. Subsequently, the party can interpret the agreement in their own interests, allegedly without violating it.

**What to do:** open the position of the other side; show that you see a double message.
