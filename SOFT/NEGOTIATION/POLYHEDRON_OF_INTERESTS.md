The polyhedron of interests is the author's development of Igor Ryzov. The development is based on a thorough analysis of interests, taking into account the desired position, the declared position and the red line. For building the polyhedron of interests need to build next five steps:

1. Interest search - Determine the main interest. Think about what additional interests you may have in solving a particular situation. All these interests will form the basis of the polyhedron.
2. Edge monetization - Value each facet according to the "currency" of primary interest. This will help you not to accept an unfavorable offer for you.
3. Development of the desired position - In this step, strart from the main interest. Think about what value of the main interest would suit you completely. Next decide how important each additional interest will be to you in this case.
4. Redline Definition - Determine the minimum value of the main benefit, less than which your interests are violated. Typically, this is the current state of your interests.
5. Construction of the declared position - Determine the value of the main interest, which will be the start in the negotiations.
