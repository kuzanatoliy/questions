  <summary>What are cognitive distortions?</summary>

Cognitive distortion is a mechanism laid down by evolution. It is necessary for a person in order to speed up the decision-making process.

For example:

* What happened recently or brightly in a memory is true;
* What is true for a lot of people is true;
* What has positive support is true;
* What I do always is true.
