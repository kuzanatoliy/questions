  <summary>What is structure of an algorithm interview?</summary>

**The Yandex version:**

1. The interviewer tells the condition of the problem. It may deliberately omit important introductory information because the candidate is expected to notice and ask.
2. The candidate discusses the solution ideas with the interviewer. From the first time, the decision may be wrong or slow - this is normal, the interviewer will point out this and offer to think more. Will give hints if needed.
3. When the candidate voices the correct solution, you can start writing code. Usually the code is written on a whiteboard or in an online editor without the ability to run the code.
4. The next important step is self-testing and bug fixing. Often, applicants miss the right test case or make the wrong correction. We will talk about how to do it right and avoid such mistakes in the next lessons.
5. The candidate and the interviewer check the code for correctness and eliminate errors.
6. If there are no errors left in the code, the interviewer can ask an additional question or move on to the next task.

  <summary>What are criterias of a successful algorithm interview?</summary>

- **Without the using of external sources**
  During an interview, a candidate cannot use external sources as books or internet and should find solution by himself.
- **For a certain time**
  Unfortunately, it is not possible to know how much time solving requires. Different criterias could effect on the solving process. Just imagine that it is needed to solve the same problem that you solved on the previous week. It is ideal, but if you don't remember solution well it will require more time.
- **Discuss and Write**
  Communication with an interviewer is important. Firstly, because it allows the candidate to solve the problem more effective. Moreover, solo development is not common.
- **In a real programming language**
  It would be better to use a real programming language. It would be better to choose the programming language that a candidate knows better.
- **Quite productive**
  It is important to provide productive solution. However, it shouldn't be the best solution.
- **No logical errors**
  A code should work correctly on valid input data: the correct answer is given in the right time, no run-time errors occur.
- **Not being able to run the code**
  The solution is written on the board or in an online editor that does not allow you to run the code.
