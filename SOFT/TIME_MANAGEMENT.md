  <summary>Who is a Time Martyr?</summary>

A person who fill his schedules with requests from others, instead of focusing on what's important to you. Your own tasks feel like too much responsibility, so you jump at the chance to take on anything else - you gain validation from others, but neglect the tasks that would bring you self-validation.

**Issues:** multitasking, missed deadlines, ineffective scheduling, skipping breaks

  <summary>Who is a Firefighter?</summary>

A perosn who tries to tackle everything on his own, right now — he's constantly putting out "fires" left and right, and don't feel fulfilled unless he's working on 10 tasks at once, and feeling "busy". Once he's done with that, you simply ask: "What's next?" — which is a practice that will lead you to burnout, sooner or later.

**Issues:** missed deadlines, skipping breaks, ineffective scheduling

  <summary>Who is a Perfectionist?</summary>

A person who wants everything to be perfect. He will work overtime, and invest all his efforts into delivering a high-quality project — but he often don't know how to quit while he's ahead, so you may miss your deadlines and risk burnout.

  <summary>What is a Pomodoro technique?</summary>

You parse your work into 25-minute work sessions (pomodoros), and 5-minute breaks. After 4 cycles, you take a 20-minute break.

Developed by Francesco Cirillo, the Pomodoro technique got its name after the Pomodoro-shaped kitchen timer Francesco used to track progress in his work.

**Time management skills it improves:** Effective planning, Stress management, Avoiding distractions, Single-tasking, Setting priorities, Saying "No"

**Issues it solves:** Ineffective scheduling, Skipping breaks, Multitasking, Missed deadlines

**How Pomodoro works:**

1. Set your timer for 25 minutes;
2. Focus on your work during these 25 minutes;
3. Stop as soon as the alarm goes off;
4. Take a 5-minute break;
5. Resume work for another 25 minutes after the break;
6. After four 25/5 minute cycles, take a 20-minute break;
7. Repeat the process until finished with task or project;
8. Time management technique Pomodoro;
9. For this purpose, you can try the Pomodoro Timer in Clockify, or learn more about how to start using Pomodoro.

**Advantages:**

1. Better time estimates for your work;
2. Fixed work time — you'll be more likely to focus;
3. Regular breaks help eliminate burnout and improve performance;
4. Pomodoros are an easy way to track profitability and productivity.

**Disadvantages:**

1. You have to stop working once the 25 minutes run out — If you're doing particularly well, this is counterproductive.
2. Following fixed intervals — the prescribed 25/5 minute sessions may not work for you.

  <summary>What is a Kanban technique?</summary>

A visual time management technique that helps you follow the progress with your projects — you track how the tasks move across differently labeled columns.

This technique was adopted in the 1960s in Japan by Taiichi Ono, for Toyota Automotive, to help increase their productivity, and effectiveness in manufacture.

**Time management skills it improves:** Effective planning, SMART goal setting, Proper task delegation, Single-tasking

**Issues it solves:** Multitasking, Missed deadlines, Ineffective scheduling

**How Kanban works:**

You can use project management software, a pen and paper, or a whiteboard and sticky notes.

Determine the number of stages in your project or task, and create the columns. For example, you can create four columns, and move tasks within a project across these stages:

_Backlog_ — you brainstorm, and define all your tasks here. You then decide what tasks you're supposed to move to the To Do column, and what tasks can wait their turn.

_To Do_ — these are the tasks you'll work on.

_In Progress_ — these are the tasks you are currently working on.

_Done_ — tasks you've finished.

**Advantages:**

1. No one-size-fits-all template, which means you can customize the principles to fit your own needs;
2. Clear visual representation of your entire work situation: straightforward representation of your progress with a project;
3. You can break the project into small, manageable tasks, and track their progress across the board;
4. The team is likely to focus on progressing with their tasks, in order to reach the "Done" column.

**Disadvantages:**

1. No one-size-fits-all template, which means creating a Kanban board can be time-consuming, as you have to decide how many columns to include and how to name them.
2. Kanban doesn't help your order tasks directly, in terms of importance and urgency.
3. May be difficult to predict when your team will finish the tasks (and project) because the only measure of progress is moving across columns; there is no time component.
