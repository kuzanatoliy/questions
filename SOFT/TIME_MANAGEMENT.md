  <summary>Who is a Time Martyr?</summary>

A person who fill his schedules with requests from others, instead of focusing on what's important to you. Your own tasks feel like too much responsibility, so you jump at the chance to take on anything else - you gain validation from others, but neglect the tasks that would bring you self-validation.

7. Repeat the process until finished with task or project;
