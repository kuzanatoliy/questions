- Working on important and urgent tasks first;
- Saving time for priority tasks, routine tasks, but also breaks;
- Proper stress management;
- Proper team management;
- Tracking project progress and identifying lags.

  <summary>Who is a Time Martyr?</summary>

A person who fill his schedules with requests from others, instead of focusing on what's important to you. Your own tasks feel like too much responsibility, so you jump at the chance to take on anything else - you gain validation from others, but neglect the tasks that would bring you self-validation.

**Issues:** multitasking, missed deadlines, ineffective scheduling, skipping breaks

  <summary>Who is a Procrastinator?</summary>

Procrastinators delay work on everything remotely important to anyone. Some claim they work better under pressure, but the results they get are often dampened by the stress and anxiety this practice brings.

**Issues:** missed deadlines, ineffective scheduling, multitasking

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Who is a Distractor?</summary>

A person who is easily distracted. A random request from a colleague is as likely to catch your fleeting attention.

**Issues:** multitasking, missed deadlines, ineffective scheduling

<details>
  <summary>Who is an Underestimator?</summary>

A person who estimates that handling a task will take much less time than it actually does — the person rarely live up to his optimistic deadlines.

**Issues:** missed deadlines, ineffective scheduling

  <summary>Who is a Firefighter?</summary>

A perosn who tries to tackle everything on his own, right now — he's constantly putting out "fires" left and right, and don't feel fulfilled unless he's working on 10 tasks at once, and feeling "busy". Once he's done with that, you simply ask: "What's next?" — which is a practice that will lead you to burnout, sooner or later.

**Issues:** missed deadlines, skipping breaks, ineffective scheduling

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Who is a Perfectionist?</summary>

A person who wants everything to be perfect. He will work overtime, and invest all his efforts into delivering a high-quality project — but he often don't know how to quit while he's ahead, so you may miss your deadlines and risk burnout.

**Issues:** missed deadlines, skipping breaks

  <summary>What is a Pomodoro technique?</summary>

You parse your work into 25-minute work sessions (pomodoros), and 5-minute breaks. After 4 cycles, you take a 20-minute break.

Developed by Francesco Cirillo, the Pomodoro technique got its name after the Pomodoro-shaped kitchen timer Francesco used to track progress in his work.

**Time management skills it improves:** Effective planning, Stress management, Avoiding distractions, Single-tasking, Setting priorities, Saying "No"

**Issues it solves:** Ineffective scheduling, Skipping breaks, Multitasking, Missed deadlines

**How Pomodoro works:**

1. Set your timer for 25 minutes;
2. Focus on your work during these 25 minutes;
3. Stop as soon as the alarm goes off;
4. Take a 5-minute break;
5. Resume work for another 25 minutes after the break;
6. After four 25/5 minute cycles, take a 20-minute break;
7. Repeat the process until finished with task or project;
8. Time management technique Pomodoro;
9. For this purpose, you can try the Pomodoro Timer in Clockify, or learn more about how to start using Pomodoro.

**Advantages:**

1. Better time estimates for your work;
2. Fixed work time — you'll be more likely to focus;
3. Regular breaks help eliminate burnout and improve performance;
4. Pomodoros are an easy way to track profitability and productivity.

**Disadvantages:**

1. You have to stop working once the 25 minutes run out — If you're doing particularly well, this is counterproductive.
2. Following fixed intervals — the prescribed 25/5 minute sessions may not work for you.

  <summary>What is a Kanban technique?</summary>

A visual time management technique that helps you follow the progress with your projects — you track how the tasks move across differently labeled columns.

This technique was adopted in the 1960s in Japan by Taiichi Ono, for Toyota Automotive, to help increase their productivity, and effectiveness in manufacture.

**Time management skills it improves:** Effective planning, SMART goal setting, Proper task delegation, Single-tasking

**Issues it solves:** Multitasking, Missed deadlines, Ineffective scheduling

**How Kanban works:**

You can use project management software, a pen and paper, or a whiteboard and sticky notes.

Determine the number of stages in your project or task, and create the columns. For example, you can create four columns, and move tasks within a project across these stages:

_Backlog_ — you brainstorm, and define all your tasks here. You then decide what tasks you're supposed to move to the To Do column, and what tasks can wait their turn.

_To Do_ — these are the tasks you'll work on.

_In Progress_ — these are the tasks you are currently working on.

_Done_ — tasks you've finished.

**Advantages:**

1. No one-size-fits-all template, which means you can customize the principles to fit your own needs;
2. Clear visual representation of your entire work situation: straightforward representation of your progress with a project;
3. You can break the project into small, manageable tasks, and track their progress across the board;
4. The team is likely to focus on progressing with their tasks, in order to reach the "Done" column.

**Disadvantages:**

1. No one-size-fits-all template, which means creating a Kanban board can be time-consuming, as you have to decide how many columns to include and how to name them.
2. Kanban doesn't help your order tasks directly, in terms of importance and urgency.
3. May be difficult to predict when your team will finish the tasks (and project) because the only measure of progress is moving across columns; there is no time component.

  <summary>What is a Getting Things Done technique?</summary>

A five-step method that allows you to brainstorm your tasks, and make them into a straightforward to-do list.

Getting Things Done (GTD) was introduced by David Allen in his book Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress Free Productivity.

**Time management skills it improves:** Effective planning, Setting priorities, SMART goal setting

**Issues it solves:** Ineffective scheduling

**How Getting Things Done works:**

1. _Capture_ — note every task that springs to mind;
2. _Clarify_ — determine whether the task is actionable and whether it has concrete steps you can lay out and follow;
3. _Organize_ — file tasks under different labels, and provide them with context (eg. home, office, request from Tom);
4. _Reflect_ — from time to time, review your tasks: What is the next step for the task? Do you really need to finish it this week?
5. _Engage_ — once you have noted, identified as actionable, properly filed, and reviewed your tasks, simply start working on them.

**Advantages:**

1. Keep all tasks, assignments and projects in perspective;
2. Clear head once you lay out every task you can think of in front;
3. You can use GTD to boost both your personal, and professional productivity.

**Disadvantages:**

1. You have to use your willpower to progress with your work — GTD doesn't provide guidelines for dealing with distractions;
2. Organization of tasks happens by context, and not by project, which may be unhelpful for people who are used to parsing tasks in relation to their project;
3. Too many items on the list can render it ineffective, as you'll be less likely to structure your day properly.

  <summary>What is an Eat that Frog technique?</summary>

This time management technique is aimed at prioritizing tasks. You pick out your most important, or worst task (this is your "frog"), and tackle it first thing tomorrow. Once you have finished with your "frog", you can move on to other tasks for the day, but not before.

This may be a task that requires all your attention (due to its importance or difficulty), one that you've been avoiding (because it's boring, demanding or difficult).

The "Eat that Frog" premise was developed by Brian Tracy, in his book Eat that Frog! 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time..

**Time management skills it improves:** Effective planning, Setting priorities, SMART goal setting

**Issues it solves:** Ineffective scheduling, Multitasking, Missed deadlines

**How Eat that frog works:**

You have to identify tasks based on their priority, and label them accordingly:

_Task A_ — most important task, the one you should tackle first, or suffer the consequences.

_Task B_ — second most important task, the one you should tackle after Task A. Less important, but still vital.

_Task C_ — a task you could do, but you wouldn't suffer consequences if you didn't do it.

_Task D_ — a task you should ideally delegate to someone else, and allocate this time to Task A.

_Task E_ — a task you don't really need to do, so you're free to eliminate it.

**Advantages:**

1. Doing the most important or worst task first thing in the morning guarantees the rest of the items in your daily schedule will be easier to accomplish — this will motivate and energize you;
2. Prioritizing tasks becomes easier;
3. You'll have the rest of the day left for more enjoyable tasks.

**Disadvantages:**

1. A difficult and demoralizing start of the day;
2. It may be rigid and impractical if your most important task changes during the course of the day.

  <summary>What is a Timeboxing technique?</summary>

You allocate time periods (timeboxes) to activities; you work within this time period, and then stop once the set time runs out. Timeboxing often includes fixed deadlines, so it's used in project management.

Timeboxing works as a more general approach to the Pomodoro technique — instead of 25-minute sessions (timeboxes), the period of time within a timebox isn't as fixed.

James Martin was the first to explain the technique in more detail, in one of the chapters of his book Rapid Application Development.

**Time management skills it improves:** Effective planning, Avoiding distractions, Single-tasking, Setting priorities

**Issues it solves:** Missed deadlines, Ineffective scheduling, Multitasking, Skipping breaks

**How timeboxing works:**

1. Lay out all your activities and tasks on a list;
2. Decide what you want to accomplish with these tasks — define your goals;
3. If a task is important and requires great focus, allocate a longer time period to it (for example, 1 or 2 hours);
4. If it's a difficult task, parse it, and allocate shorter time periods (for example, 20-30 minutes) to parts of it, to make the task easier to manage;
5. Start from your first task, and work your way down;
6. When the allocated time for a task is up, stop working on it;
7. Take a break;
8. Review what you've managed to accomplish;
9. Turn your attention to other time boxes in your schedule.

**Advantages:**

1. Great for a large number of small tasks — it'll be easier to keep track of them and tackle them, once you have them laid out in timeboxes;
2. Deadlines are an important component, so you'll be focused on achieving as much as you can until the timebox expires;
3. Natural perfectionists will have less time to tweak every detail, as they'll have to move on to the next task in the schedule;
4. Timeboxing doesn't allow multitasking, so you'll be able to focus on one task at a time.

**Disadvantages:**

1. You have to stop working on a task when the time for it expires, which is counterproductive when you find yourself immersed in a task;
2. It may be challenging to stick to a strict schedule determined by timeboxes, when you consider unavoidable interruptions, such as phone calls;
3. Your timeboxing calculations may be off. Too short timeboxes — you may have to stop before you're even immersed in a task. Too long timeboxes — you may lose focus, or start procrastinating to pass the time until the end of the timebox.

  <summary>What is a Time blocking technique?</summary>

You block out time for a specific activity or task and work on it during this time period.

This time management technique was made popular by Elon Musk.

**Time management skills it improves:** Effective planning, Avoiding distractions, Single-tasking, Setting priorities, SMART goal setting

**Issues it solves:** Missed deadlines, Ineffective scheduling, Multitasking, Skipping breaks

**How time blocking works:**

There are 4 stages to Time Blocking:

1. The planning stage:

- Define your tasks and activities, identify priorities

2. The blocking stage:

- Assign each task with a specific time block — number of minutes or hours, with specific days, start and end times noted in your calendar;
- The time block can be shorter, for example, 10 minutes, or longer, for example, 90 minutes. This depends on the priority level of the task;
- Block more time for priority tasks; also, allocate these tasks to the time of day when you're the most productive;
- Block your less productive time of the day for less important tasks.
  Note everything in a calendar: the day, the start time, and the end time.

3. The acting stage:

- Start working on the first daily task (usually your priority task);
- Work your way down your schedule;
- Take breaks between time blocks, and schedule these breaks;
- Hold a flexible view on your time blocking schedule: if you receive an urgent task, block an appropriate amount of time for it, and start working on it as soon as possible.

4. The revision stage:

- If you see a task takes longer or shorter than you estimated, revise the schedule for other tasks you've planned for that day.

**Advantages:**

1. A comprehensive way of keeping track of your work day;
2. Works great with Cal Newport's idea of deep work, as you have to stick to a fixed schedule for when you'll focus on a task;
3. You'll feel like you have better control of your workload.

**Disadvantages:**

1. Unexpected interruptions may disrupt your schedule;
2. Same as with Timeboxing, your time calculations may be off — you may procrastinate while waiting for a too long time block to end or rush to beat the time during a too short time block;
3. Time-consuming to plan time blocks in your calendar for all your activities, every day.

  <summary>What is an Inbox-Zero technique?</summary>

This is an approach for managing your email inbox — you aim at keeping your email inbox empty, or close to empty.

The approach was developed by Merlin Mann, an expert in the field of productivity.

**Time management skills it improves:** Avoiding distractions, Single-tasking, Setting priorities, Stress management, Effective planning

**Issues it solves:** Ineffective scheduling, Multitasking

**How Inbox-Zero works:**

1. Determine the time of day you'll work on managing your inbox — stick to this time;
2. Silence notifications, and don't leave the email tab in your browser open;
3. Prioritize your emails:

- Respond right away to most important emails, and emails you can answer quickly;
- Move emails that'll take you longer to answer to a "needs a response" folder (allocate some of your "manage inbox" time to these responses);
- Decide what messages you can delegate, and then forward them to other team members;
- Delete and archive unwanted, or old messages.

**Advantages:**

1. A great method for managing an inbox with a lot of traffic;
2. Decreases the number of unread messages, those stopping you from finding your important emails;
3. Focused on allocating inbox management only to a specific part of the day, so you won't be distracted by emails throughout the day.

**Disadvantages:**

1. Time-consuming, considering you have to forward, archive and delete a lot of the messages;
2. Only deals with inbox management, so it has to be combined with other time management techniques, ones that focus on managing tasks and projects;
3. Problematic for people who converse with clients and colleagues through email — important emails may get lost.
