  <summary>Give us an example of a time you had to make a person sacrifice to get the job done? Was the sacrifice worth it and why?</summary>

I cannot say that an end justifies the means. Unfortunately, from time to time, an employee could lose motivation and effectiveness over time. I'm not sure if we can avoid it. So in this case, I can make a person sacrifice and involve another person in work. In my opinion, it is a win/win situation. The person gets a chance to change his routine and gets a new challenge in the feature.

  <summary>Describe a situation when you had to take on tedious work and outside the scope of your role for the good of the team? Why did you do so? How did you feel about taking on the work?</summary>

I don't like tedious work ofcourse. From time to time, the work is necessary and I do it. Besides, my experience tells me that it is not a success type of work and employees would be nice if someone take it.

  <summary>What kinds of your hours do you generally work? How do you define your ideal schedule?</summary>

Generally, I cannot say that I have some schedule for work and rest because I cannot say that my self-projects mentoring programs aren't work and it is overtime activity that requires some times. On the other hand, for customers I work about eight hours and it is enough. Also I cannot mention that I have an ideal schedule. Maybe having a flexible working day is important for me because from time to time it could be useful to start work late or increase lunch time. That is all.
