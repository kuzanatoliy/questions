  <summary>Give us an example of a time you had to make a person sacrifice to get the job done? Was the sacrifice worth it and why?</summary>

I cannot say that an end justifies the means. Unfortunately, from time to time, an employee could lose motivation and effectiveness over time. I'm not sure if we can avoid it. So in this case, I can make a person sacrifice and involve another person in work. In my opinion, it is a win/win situation. The person gets a chance to change his routine and gets a new challenge in the feature.

  <summary>Describe a situation when you had to take on tedious work and outside the scope of your role for the good of the team? Why did you do so? How did you feel about taking on the work?</summary>

I don't like tedious work ofcourse. From time to time, the work is necessary and I do it. Besides, my experience tells me that it is not a success type of work and employees would be nice if someone take it.
