  <summary>Give us an example of a time you had to make a person sacrifice to get the job done? Was the sacrifice worth it and why?</summary>

I cannot say that an end justifies the means. Unfortunately, from time to time, an employee could lose motivation and effectiveness over time. I'm not sure if we can avoid it. So in this case, I can make a person sacrifice and involve another person in work. In my opinion, it is a win/win situation. The person gets a chance to change his routine and gets a new challenge in the feature.
