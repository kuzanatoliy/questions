  <summary>Tell me about the most important accomplishments of your career. You've obviously accomplished a great deal. To what do you attribute that success?</summary>

Generally, I cannot say that I have the most important accomplishments. Maybe it is because I don't think about it. Usually, when I reach a goal, I just move on to the next one. I know what I really want to get in the feature and move on to my purpose. What about attributing the success? I'm not sure that I can mention one attribute. But maybe one of the most important is stress resistance. It allows me to continue to move.

  <summary>How do you handle apologies, either giving or accepting them?</summary>

It is a little bit difficult question because of I don't like handle apologies. I assume that many people don't like apologies too. Unfortunately, it is impossible to avoid conflicts. As result from time to time it is necessary to apologize for saving good relationships. Generally I preferred to write some message if wasn't right.

  <summary>What do you expect from your role in the team? What do you expect from your team members?</summary>

In my opinion, the main point for me and my team members are motivation. I preferred to see  coleguess who like their work and want to work. If speak about my role in the team I like to share my knowledge, play a lead role in the design and development of the complex features. From time to time I could be a driver into code quality. For example, I preferred to add some linter rules instead of looking for mistakes during code review.

Additionally, teamlead role is not right for me because I don't have good emphaty but I try playing an active role during design and solving new features. For TechLead the best role in the feature.
