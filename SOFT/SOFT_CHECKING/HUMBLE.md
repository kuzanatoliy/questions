  <summary>Tell me about the most important accomplishments of your career. You've obviously accomplished a great deal. To what do you attribute that success?</summary>

Generally, I cannot say that I have the most important accomplishments. Maybe it is because I don't think about it. Usually, when I reach a goal, I just move on to the next one. I know what I really want to get in the feature and move on to my purpose. What about attributing the success? I'm not sure that I can mention one attribute. But maybe one of the most important is stress resistance. It allows me to continue to move.
