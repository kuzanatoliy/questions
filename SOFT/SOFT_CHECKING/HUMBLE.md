<details>
  <summary>Tell me about the most important accomplishments of your career. You've obviously accomplished a great deal. To what do you attribute that success?</summary>

Generally, I cannot say that I have the most important accomplishments. Maybe it is because I don't think about it. Usually, when I reach a goal, I just move on to the next one. I know what I really want to get in the feature and move on to my purpose. What about attributing the success? I'm not sure that I can mention one attribute. But maybe one of the most important is stress resistance. It allows me to continue to move.

  <summary>How do you handle apologies, either giving or accepting them?</summary>

It is a little bit difficult question because of I don't like handle apologies. I assume that many people don't like apologies too. Unfortunately, it is impossible to avoid conflicts. As result from time to time it is necessary to apologize for saving good relationships. Generally I preferred to write some message if wasn't right.

  <summary>What do you expect from your role in the team? What do you expect from your team members?</summary>

In my opinion, the main point for me and my team members are motivation. I preferred to see  coleguess who like their work and want to work. If speak about my role in the team I like to share my knowledge, play a lead role in the design and development of the complex features. From time to time I could be a driver into code quality. For example, I preferred to add some linter rules instead of looking for mistakes during code review.

Additionally, teamlead role is not right for me because I don't have good emphaty but I try playing an active role during design and solving new features. For TechLead the best role in the feature.

  <summary>What was the most painful moment in your career that caused serious consequences for your professional life? Maybe, a serious bug in the code or mistaken estimations. How did you handle that painful moment or failure?</summary>

Generally, I have rich working experience as a result I have many mistakes during my career path. I cannot say that I have something special. Ofcourse, I had mistakes in the estimation process and I had serious bugs. It could be solved. For example, I had one situation when I was involved in the migration of one application to AWS stack our management forgot about the part of the client gets information through proxy server that cut part of the custom HTTP headers. As a result, we cannot meet deadlines and should make addition investigations and development.

  <summary>What would you like to change about yourself, or better yet, what would your best friends say you should work on?</summary>

It is a little bit difficult question because I can find many points for growing and I pay attention to it. In my opinion, one of the most important is emphaty. I must understand people more, especially their mood and feel. This should allow me to build a more effective team in the future.
