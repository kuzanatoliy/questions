  <summary>Tell me about the most important accomplishments of your career. You've obviously accomplished a great deal. To what do you attribute that success?</summary>

Generally, I cannot say that I have the most important accomplishments. Maybe it is because I don't think about it. Usually, when I reach a goal, I just move on to the next one. I know what I really want to get in the feature and move on to my purpose. What about attributing the success? I'm not sure that I can mention one attribute. But maybe one of the most important is stress resistance. It allows me to continue to move.

  <summary>How do you handle apologies, either giving or accepting them?</summary>

It is a little bit difficult question because of I don't like handle apologies. I assume that many people don't like apologies too. Unfortunately, it is impossible to avoid conflicts. As result from time to time it is necessary to apologize for saving good relationships. Generally I preferred to write some message if wasn't right.
