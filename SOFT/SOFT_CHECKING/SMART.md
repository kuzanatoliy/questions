  <summary>Imagine that during a meeting, one of your team members brought up and idea that you thought was unreasonable. Surprisingly, the rest of the team seemed just as enthusiastic about the idea. How would you handle this situation?</summary>

This depends on the cost of the idea. If the team has capacity and the idea is not expensive. The team members could be free to try. In another case, I would redirect the enthusiasm to other points. As a result, it should save the team's mood.
