# Facade

<details>
  <summary>What is a Facade?</summary>

It is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

Applicability:

- Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
- Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.

Prons:

- It is possible to isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.
  Cons:
- A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app.
