## Design patterns

<details>
  <summary>What are design patterns?</summary>

Design patterns are standard solutions to common problems in a software design. Each design pattern provides a customized blueprint for exacting problems. As a result, you cannot copy a pattern in your program, but you can use it as a design solution to your problem. The design patterns could be confused with algorithms because both concepts describe standard solutions to some known targets. But while an algorithm has always defined a clear set of actions, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution.

  <summary>Why should patterns be learned?</summary>
  
  The truth is that a programmer can work without knowledge about patterns. Moreover, in this case, he can implement a pattern solution without knowing about it. So, why is it needed to learn them?

There are a few reasons:

1. Firstly, design patterns are a toolkit of solutions to common problems in software design. So, the programmer could solve problems using them.

2. Secondly, design patterns are a common language that allows having more effective communication.
