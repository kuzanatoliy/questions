# Principles

## SOLID

<details>
  <summary>What is SOLID?</summary>

The single responsibility principle - each class should have only one reason to change. Everything within a class should do one thing, so there is only one reason for the class to change. If you are thinking about the responsibilities of a class and adding “and” to describe them, it means that the class may have several reasons to change in the future when you need to scale or update your application. Creating classes that focus on one purpose each, however, will make your code easier to understand and maintain.

The open-closed principle - each entity should be open for expansion and be closed for modification.

The Liskov substitution principle - any subclass should supplement the parent class but not change it.

The interface segregation principle - a few separate interfaces are better than one combined interface.

The dependency inversion principle - dependencies should be only on abstractions.

## YAGNI

<details>
  <summary>What is YAGNI?</summary>

YAGNI or you aren’t gonna need it is one of the design principles. YAGNI says that the programmer should not implement functionality if it is not necessary. There are a few reasons. Firstly, a customer does not have to pay for something that is not needed for him. Secondary, additional functionality could increase the development difficulty of other features.
