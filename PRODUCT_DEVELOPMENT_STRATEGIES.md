  <summary>What are the stages of product development?</summary>

Product development includes all aspects of producing innovation, from thinking of a concept to delivering the product to customers. When modifying an existing product to create new interest, these stages verify the potential success of the modifications at generating business. The seven stages of product development are:

1. Idea development: Idea development involves brainstorming for new products and ways to make existing products more relevant.
2. Editing and selection: During the selection process, the product development team determines which ideas have the most potential to do well in the market.
3. Prototype creation: Once an idea has been selected, the company must create a prototype or draft version of its proposed product. This prototype can be used to determine if the product functions as intended and appeals to your target audience.
4. Analysis: At the analysis stage of product development, the company studies market research and evaluates the possible problems with the product.
5. Product creation: After incorporating notes from the analysis into the prototype, the finished product can be created.
6. Market testing: Before releasing the product to a wider audience, products are often released to a smaller market or focus group. The market testing phase includes evaluating customer feedback and the effectiveness of the product's marketing.
7. Commercialization: The final stage of product development occurs when adjustments are made based on market testing and the product is released to the full market.

  <summary>What is a minimum viable project?</summary>

A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development.

A focus on releasing an MVP means that developers potentially avoid lengthy and (ultimately) unnecessary work. Instead, they iterate on working versions and respond to feedback, challenging and validating assumptions about a product's requirements. It may also involve carrying out market analysis beforehand. The MVP is analogous to experimentation in the scientific method applied in the context of validating business hypotheses. It is utilized so that prospective entrepreneurs would know whether a given business idea would actually be viable and profitable by testing the assumptions behind a product or business idea. The concept can be used to validate a market need for a product and for incremental developments of an existing product. As it tests a potential business model to customers to see how the market would react, it is especially useful for new/startup companies who are more concerned with finding out where potential business opportunities exist rather than executing a prefabricated, isolated business model.
