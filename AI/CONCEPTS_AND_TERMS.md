  <summary>What is an Artificial Intelligence?</summary>

AI is a science that helps computers and machines act “smart,” think like humans, and complete tasks on their own. Its main goal is to create systems that understand the world, adapt to changes, and interact well with people. AI aims to boost our abilities, increase efficiency, and transform our lives by learning, reasoning, solving problems, and making decisions.

  <summary>What is an Machine learning?</summary>

AI focuses on giving computers human-like abilities, while ML trains them to do these tasks. Unlike traditional programming, ML doesn't use explicit logic coding. Instead of manually setting search engine rules, computer models now learn user preferences and provide personalized content for each person.

  <summary>What is a Language Modeling?</summary>

Language modeling is fundamental to LLMs and involves predicting the next word (token) given the context of the preceding words, using mathematical calculations and probability. With its self-attention mechanism, the transformer architecture enables LLMs to effectively learn and generate language by capturing dependencies and patterns within the input data.
