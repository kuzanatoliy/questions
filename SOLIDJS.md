  <summary>What is SolidJS?</summary>

Solid is a JavaScript framework for making interactive web applications in a declarative style (it links data and classes that it uses and creates). Also it allows to use JSX, that allows using existing HTML and JavaScript knowledge to build components that can be reused throughout your app.

  <summary>What is a JSX?</summary>

JSX is HTML-like syntax that can be used for building components. JSX adds dynamic expressions that allow you to reference variables and functions within your HTML by using the { } syntax.

It is possible to mention three main differences between JSX and HTML that prevent JSX from being seen as a superset of HTML:


* JSX does not have void elements. This means that all elements must have a closing tag or self-close;
* JSX must return a single Element;
* JSX does not support the HTML Comments.

  <summary>What is a Component?</summary>

Components are functions that typically return JSX and other components can call them by JSX in other components.
