  <summary>What is an Encapsulation?</summary>

Is hiding information inside a particular namespace (container) to limit direct communication with it. We can have one object/class consisting of different variables and functions. Encapsulation prevents or restricts (e.g., read but not write) interaction with some of them.

  <summary>What is an Abstraction?</summary>

The process of generalization (also modeling). We replace a particular thing by its more general model. Allow us not to be coupled with implementation details, to use any implementation, satisfying specific interface.

An abstract class is a class with at least one abstract method. Abstract class's non-abstract methods can have implementations, but a class itself can't.

An interface is an abstract class, which methods are only abstract.
