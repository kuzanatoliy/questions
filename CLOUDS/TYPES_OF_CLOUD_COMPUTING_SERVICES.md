Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service that offers essential compute, storage, and networking resources on demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis. IaaS is one of the four types of cloud services, along with software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and serverless.

**Common IaaS business scenarios**

- Lift-and-shift migration
- Test and development
- Storage, backup, and recovery
- Web apps
- High-performance computing

**Advantages of IaaS**

- Reduces capital expenditures and optimizes costs
- Increases scale and performance of IT workloads
- Increases stability, reliability, and supportability

  <summary>What is platform as a service (PaaS)?</summary>

Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. You purchase the resources you need from a cloud service provider on a pay-as-you-go basis and access them over a secure Internet connection.

**Common PaaS business scenarios**

- Development framework.
- Analytics or business intelligence.
- Additional services.

**Advantages of PaaS**

- Cut coding time.
- Add development capabilities without adding staff.
- Develop for multiple platforms—including mobile—more easily.
- Use sophisticated tools affordably.
- Support geographically distributed development teams.
- Efficiently manage the application lifecycle.

**Advantages of PaaS**

- Gain access to sophisticated applications.
- Pay only for what you use.
- Use free client software.
- Mobilize your workforce easily.
