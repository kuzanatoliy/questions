# Client-Side Script Techniques

<details>
  <summary>What abjective of allowing the user to extend the default time limit?</summary>

The objective of this technique is to allow user to extend the default time limit by providing a mechanism to extend the time when scripts provide functionality that has default time limits. In order to allow the user to request a longer time limit, the script can provide a form allowing the user to enter a larger time limit or indicating that more time is needed.

**Procedure:**

1. On a Web page that uses scripts to enforce a time limit, wait until the time limit has expired.
2. Determine if an option was provided to extend the time limit.
