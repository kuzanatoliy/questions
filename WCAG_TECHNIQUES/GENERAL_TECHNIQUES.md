  <summary>What abjective of adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area?</summary>

The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism to bypass blocks of material that are repeated on multiple Web pages by skipping directly to the main content of the Web page. The first interactive item in the Web page is a link to the beginning of the main content. Activating the link sets focus beyond the other content to the main content. This technique is most useful when a Web page has one main content area, rather than a set of content areas that are equally importatn, and when there are not multiple navigation sections on the page.

**Procedure:**

1. Check that a link is the first focusable control on the Web page.
2. Check that the description of the link communicates that it links to the main content.
3. Check that the link is either always visible or visible when it has keyboard focus.
4. Check that activating the link moves the focus to the main content.
5. Check that after activationg the link, the keyboard focus has moved to the main content.

  <summary>What abjective of allowing the content to be paused and restarted from where it was paused?</summary>

The objective of this technique is to provide a way to pause movement or scrolling of content. If the user needs to pause the movement, to reduce distraction or to have time to read it, they can do so, and then restart it as needed. This mechanism can be provided either through interactive controls that conform to WCAG or through keyboard shortcuts. If keyboard shortcuts are used, they are documented.

**Procedure:**

1. Use the mechanism provided in the Web page or by the user agent to pause the moving or scrolling content.
2. Check that the moving or scrolling has stopped and does not restart by itself.
3. Use the mechanism provided to restart the moving content.
4. Check that the movement or scrolling has resumed from the point where it was stopped.

  <summary>What abjective of providing a movie with extended audio descriptions?</summary>

The objective of this technique is to provide a second version of video content that provides extended audion descriptions. One of the difficult things about creating traditional audio descriptions is that the narrotor somethimes has to provide a lot of information during very short pauses in dialogue. Extended audion description temporatily pauses the audion and video to allow critical information to be delivered when pauses in dialogue are insufficient for adequeate description.

**Procedure:**

1. Open the version of the movie that includes extended audio descriptions.
2. Check that the video halts for extended audio description when there is not enough space to include necessary narration between the natural dialogue.
3. Check that the necessary information is in the audio description.
4. If the alternate version(s) are on a separate page, check for the availability of link(s) to allow the user to get to the other versions.
