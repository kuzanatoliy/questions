  <summary>What abjective of adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area?</summary>

The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism to bypass blocks of material that are repeated on multiple Web pages by skipping directly to the main content of the Web page. The first interactive item in the Web page is a link to the beginning of the main content. Activating the link sets focus beyond the other content to the main content. This technique is most useful when a Web page has one main content area, rather than a set of content areas that are equally importatn, and when there are not multiple navigation sections on the page.

**Procedure:**

1. Check that a link is the first focusable control on the Web page.
2. Check that the description of the link communicates that it links to the main content.
3. Check that the link is either always visible or visible when it has keyboard focus.
4. Check that activating the link moves the focus to the main content.
5. Check that after activationg the link, the keyboard focus has moved to the main content.
