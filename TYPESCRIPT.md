  <summary>What is typescript? Why is it needed?</summary>

  TypeScript is a programming language that adds additional functional opportunities into JavaScript. One of the most important is typing.

  Pros:

  Typescript allows using new features from ECMAScript and compiling them into older versions.

  It allows using static types and manipulating them (logic operation, using of generics, etc.).

  IDEs improve workflow due to getting information from the typescript compiler in real-time.

  Corporate support.
