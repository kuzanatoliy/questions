  <summary>What is typescript? Why is it needed?</summary>

  TypeScript is a programming language that adds additional functional opportunities into JavaScript. One of the most important is typing.

  Pros:

  1. Typescript allows using new features from ECMAScript and compiling them into older versions.
  2. It allows using static types and manipulating them (logic operation, using of generics, etc.).
  3. IDEs improve workflow due to getting information from the typescript compiler in real-time.
  4. Corporate support.

<details>
  <summary>What are getters/setters in TypeScript?</summary>

  They are functions that control access to class properties.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is it possible to use TypeScript in back-end development?</summary>

  Yes. It is possible to use TypeScript for developing applications on NodeJS.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the main TypeScript components?</summary>

  1. Programming Language.
  2. Compilator. Allow turning TypeScriont into JavaScript.
  3. Tools.

<details>
  <summary>What are decorators in TypeScript?</summary>

  Decorator is a TypeScript opportunity that allows composing general functionality and decorating a class or its methods.

</details>
