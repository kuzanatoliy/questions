  <summary>What are Micro Frontend's characteristics?</summary>

  * One team develop an app. It doesn't mean that only a single team has responsibility for fixing all bugs. It means that each subdomain has a dedicated team that carries the domain knowledge about business logic and tech stack.
  * Independent implementation. The team that owns the micro app has the freedom for choosing a tech stack.
  * Independent deployment. It is possible to deploy each micro-app individually and host it on separate domains.
  * Decoupling. Micro-apps have to be as decoupled as possible. The dependency between them ideally should not exist.
  * Fault tolerance. One of the benefits of micro frontend architecture is reliability. One broken micro-app doesn't affect the whole application.
