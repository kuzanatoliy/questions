# Aria Roles

<details>
  <summary>What are aria roles?</summary>

ARIA roles provide semantic meaning to content, allowing screen readers and other tools to present and support interaction with object in a way that is consistent with user expectations of that type of object. ARIA roles can be used to describe elements that don't natively exist in HTML or exist but don't yet have full browser support.

  <summary>What is alert role?</summary>

The alert role is used to communicate an important and usually time-sensitive message to the user. When this role is added to an element, the browser will send out an accessible alert event to assistive technology products which can then notify the user.

The alert role should only be used for information that requires the user's immediate attention, for example:

- An invalid value was entered into a form field
- The user's login session is about to expire
- The connection to the server was lost so local changes will not be saved

**Note** It is possible to use aria-live="alert" instead of the role.
