<details>
  <summary>What is aria?</summary>

The ARIA modifies the accessibility tree, modifying how assistive technology presents the content to your users. ARIA doesn't change anything about an element's function or behavior. When not using semantic HTML elements for their intended purpose and default functionality, you must use JavaScript to manage behavior, focus, and ARIA states.
