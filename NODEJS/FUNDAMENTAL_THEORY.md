  NodeJS is a programming platform for running JavaScript and turning the language into a common language. Also, NodeJS adds opportunities to communicate with output/input through NodeJS API and use external modules. The base using sphere is the development of web-servers. Moreover, NodeJS allows creating desktop applications(for example, it is possible to use Electron). NodeJS uses an event-driven model and async or reactive programming with not blocked output/input.
  For using could be downloaded one of the NodeJS versions from the official website. Besides, it is possible to turn between versions with the nvm application.
