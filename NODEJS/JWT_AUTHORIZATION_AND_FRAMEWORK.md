  <summary>What are the differences between authentication and authorization?</summary>
  
  A lot of times, authentication and authorization are mixed sentences. But they have differences between each other.

  Authentication is validating user credentials such as username, password, etc. An authenticating system usually identities users by a username and password. Besides, the auth systems could have different elements. Based on the security level, authentication factors can vary from one of the following:
  
  * Single-Factor Authentication: This is the simplest form of authentication method, which requires a password to grant user access to a particular system such as a website or a network. 
  
  * Two-Factor Authentication: This is the most popular and safe authentication type. It requires not only a username and password but also a piece of information only the user knows. 
  
  * Multi-Factor Authentication: This is the most advanced type of authentication, which requires two or more levels of security from independent categories of authentication to grant user access to the system.
  
  Authorization is a process that allows getting access to resources such as files, databases, APIs, etc. So authorization verifies user rights.
