  <summary>Why is it pretty good to structure NodeJS application source?</summary>
  
  All of the programmers want to support and increase functionality as easy as possible. One of the main parts of using clean code is using a code structure. So, it is possible to use a lot of ways of code organization. For example, it is possible to organize code by functionality. In this way, to put controller to controllers, server to servers, etc. One more example is an organization by modules. In this way, all functionality depended on users to put the user directory. In my personal opinion, the last one allows splitting functionality to microservices as easy as possible and allows to support more clear file structure.
