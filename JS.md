  <summary>What is the difference between Bind, Call and Apply?</summary>

  If we have any method inside an object and we want to apply that to another one, in that case, we can use the Bind, Call and Apply method.

  Firstly, Call: Need to call the Call method and send the object and parameters with separating a coma.

  Secondly, Apply: It is possible to call the Applymethod and send the object and other parameters through an array.

  Third, Bind: If it is needed to use a method, again and again, need to bind it with the new object. The bind creates a new function that will call the original one with context.

  It is not possible to use Bind, Call and Apply with the arrow function.
