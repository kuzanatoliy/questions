### Questions

<details>
  <summary>What are Truthy and False values?</summary>

What are Truthy and False values?

Falsy values:

false, 0, “”, undefined, NaN

Truthy values:

Truthy values are everything except falsy values.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between Null and Undefined?</summary>

Undefined can be found in different ways. Such as for not setting value, accessing elements or proper which do not exist.

For null a value, we will have to set it.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the difference between double equal (==) and triple equal (===)?</summary>

Triple(===) check the value and type both.

Double(==) convert type and after that compare values. At the time of converting and, comparing it follows its own rules.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the closure?</summary>

When we call or return a function inside of another method, they create a closed environment.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between Bind, Call and Apply?</summary>

If we have any method inside an object and we want to apply that to another one, in that case, we can use the Bind, Call and Apply method.

Firstly, Call: Need to call the Call method and send the object and parameters with separating a coma.

Secondly, Apply: It is possible to call the Applymethod and send the object and other parameters through an array.

Third, Bind: If it is needed to use a method, again and again, need to bind it with the new object. The bind creates a new function that will call the original one with context.

It is not possible to use Bind, Call and Apply with the arrow function.

<details>
  <summary>What is the Window?</summary>

A window is a global object that provides an interface for working with a DOM model of a document. It is possible to use the window object in each browser.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a global variable?</summary>

A global variable is a variable that is available from any function.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a setTimeout method?</summary>

The setTimeout method evaluates an expression or calls a function after a specified time.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a setInterval method?</summary>

The setInterval method will continue calling the function until the interval would be active.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What data types are in JavaScript?</summary>

The JavaScript language has two groups of data types: primitive data types and referential data types. The difference between the groups in access type. Primitive gets by value. Referential gets by link.
The data types: Number, BigInt, String, Boolean, null, undefined, Object, Symbol.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How to check that the object is an array?</summary>

It is possible to check that object is an array by Array.isArray method or duck typing.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How to check if a number is finite?</summary>

But they have a difference in behaviour. The global isFinite try to turn the string value into a number.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How to check that a variable is NaN?</summary>

- isNaN - return true for NaN and undefined.
- Number.isNaN - return true only for NaN.
- NaN only one variable that is not equal itself.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between var, let and const?</summary>

- var has a function visibility area and pops up
- let, const has a block visibility area and not pop up
- const cannot be reset

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between callbacks, promises, async / await?</summary>

All of them are ways for working with async functionality.

- Callback allows putting function that will run with the result of the async operation.
- Promises is a modern way of working with async functionality. A promise is an object that contains its state and is a microtask.
- Async / Await is syntax sugar that provides a more comfortable way to work with promises.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is it possible to add new methods into standard classes?</summary>

It is possible, but it is not good practice.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the Promise in JavaScript?</summary>

A promise is an object that stores its state (pending, fulfilled, rejected). It is a more high-tech functionality for working with async code in JavaScript.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What states does the Promise have?</summary>

- pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- fulfilled: meaning that the operation was successful.
- rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are methods from the Promise class?</summary>

- .resolve - cover value into success promise.
- .reject - cover value into error handler.
- .all - wait for all success promises or reject them if one has an error.
- .allSettled - returns all resolved and rejected Promises.
- .race - returns first success of failure promise.
- .any - returns any successful promise.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the methods from the Promise prototype?</summary>

- then - set success and error handler.
- .catch - set error handler.
- .finaly - set a handler that is not dependent on the result (error or success).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Explain TC39 Process?</summary>

This process is built from five stages, starting with stage zero. Any proposal for a change in the specification goes through these stages.

- Stage 0 (Strawperson):
  It represents an initial idea for adding or changing the specification.
- Stage 1 (Proposal):
  It describes a discrete problem or general need, suggests a shape of the solution and points out potential challenges.
- Stage 2 (Draft):
  It describes the syntax, semantics and APIs, although it can have 'todo' comments or placeholders. An experimental implementation should be runnable by a browser or a build-time transpiler.
- Stage 3 (Candidate):
  It is ready for feedback and refinements from implementations and users.
- Stage 4 (Finished):
  It indicates that the proposal is ready to be included in the latest draft of the specification - and be delivered with its next edition.

  <summary>What data collections are in JavaScript?</summary>

- The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys.
- The WeakMap holds key/value pairs whose keys must be objects, with values of any arbitrary JavaScript type, and which does not create strong references to its keys.
- The Set object is collection of values. You can iterate its elements in insertion order. A value in a Set may only occur once; it is unique in the Set's collection.
- The WeekSet object is collection of objects. An object in the WeakSet may only occur once. It is unique in the WeakSet's collection, and objects are not enumerable.
