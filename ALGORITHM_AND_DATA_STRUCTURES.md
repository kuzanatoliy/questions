<details>
  <summary>What is Algorithm?</summary>

An algorithm is an instruction that describes the order in which actions are to be performed. Algorithms describe how we transform data to get the desired result.

  <summary>What is Data Structure?</summary>

A data structure is a software unit that allows storing and processing data of the same type and/or logically related data.

  <summary>What is time complexity?</summary>

In general, the complexity is estimated as follows:
First, determine what blocks, independent in terms of operations, the program consists of. Calculate the execution time for each. The resulting time will be the maximum of these values.
For a block, count the number of operations of different types and the cost of each type of operation. The cost is clear: as a rule, it depends on the data structures with which the interaction takes place.

  <summary>What is off-by-one error?</summary>

It is error in index (+1). It could happen:

- during calculation of the array index
- if mix strong and not strong comparison

  <summary>What is binary search?</summary>

Binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

  <summary>What is recursion?</summary>

Recursion is when a function calls itself. Recursion is not a specific algorithm, but a technique that allows algorithms to be implemented.

  <summary>What is divide and conquer method?</summary>

It is possible to provide follow work flow:

1. The source data is divided into several parts.
2. For each part, the function is called recursively.
3. The results of recursive calls are merged.

  <summary>What is Insertion sort?</summary>

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.

<details>
  <summary>What is Quick sort?</summary>

Quicksort is an in-place sorting algorithm. Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be somewhat faster than merge sort and about two or three times faster than heapsort.
